Q.11 A 78 year old male, Mr. Jules Bode, with PMH of HTN, DM type 2, newly diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation on Coumadin comes to ER with complaining of epistaxis since morning. You knocked the door and entered the room. He mentioned you "doc, I know it is because of Coumadin. I will not take it anymore."
Mr. Bode, I think you are right. Coumadin makes your blood very thin that you can bleed a lot. Therefore, you should stop taking it.
Mr. Bode, I think epistaxis is mostly due to nose-picking. Therefore, you don't need to stop Coumadin. It will prevent you from getting stroke.
Mr. Bode, I am very happy that you are aware of side-effects of Coumadin. I agree you should stop taking it.
Mr. Bode, I agree that Coumadin can be cause of your epistaxis as it makes your blood very thin. However, it could be something else as well. Therefore, we should first find out what is causing it. So do you mind if I ask you few questions and do quick physical examination?

Here, patient is aware of side-effects of Coumadin that is good thing but as a physician you should counsel that epistaxis can be caused by many other reasons.
