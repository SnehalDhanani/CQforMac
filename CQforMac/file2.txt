Q.33 A 42 year old male, Mr. Anthony Remuzzi, comes to clinic for routine physical examination. He denied any symptoms. He has been smoking 1 PPD for last 15 years and never tried to quit smoking. He also drinks beer occasionally and denied any illegal drugs. You counseled him health hazards of smoking and encouraged him to quit smoking. During conversation, you mentioned possibility of getting lung cancer. He asked quickly, "Doc, could you please get CT scan of lung to check whether I have any tumor in the Lung?"
Mr. Remuzzi, as a long standing smoker, you are at high risk for Lung Cancer. Therefore, I also think that we should get CT scan of lung to check whether you have tumor in the Lung. So let me order it for you.
Mr. Remuzzi, I can understand your worry but first you need to quit smoking before I can get CT scan of Lung. So let me refer you to smoking cessation program.
Mr. Remuzzi, I don’t think you have Lung Cancer. It won’t be useful. However, I think you should quit smoking.
Mr. Remuzzi, I would like to tell you that as a long-standing smoker you are at high risk for Lung Cancer, but till now there is not any single proven test to screen for Lung Cancer including CT scan of Lung. However, I strongly suggest you to quit smoking. Is that fine with you?

Many cancers can be detected early by effective screening tests.    Examples:1) Breast Cancer- Yearly Mammogram after 40 years of age. 2) Colon Cancer- 10-yearly Colonoscopy or Yearly Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT) and 5-yearly Sigmoidoscopy after 50 years of age. 3) Cervical Cancer-Yearly Pap smear. However, there is not any single proven cost-effective screening test for Lung Cancer including among active smokers. It leads to unnecessary further follow-up including invasive tests. This should be explained to patient and smoking cessation should be strongly recommended.

Q:34 A 24 year old male, Mr. Joseph Ammann, comes to clinic with routine physical check-up in the winter. He denied any complaints. He smokes 5 cigarettes every day but denied any alcohol and illegal drugs. You recommended him to quit smoking and get annual flu vaccine. He resisted you, "Doc, I don’t want to take flu vaccine as I heard that some people get fever after that."
Mr. Ammann, you are right, some people do get fever after getting flu vaccine. Therefore, if you are afraid of it, then you should not take it. However avoid contact with any person who has flu.
Mr. Ammann, yes, some people might get low-grade fever but it will subside after day or two. You can also get Tylenol for it. However, it prevents you from getting flu this winter. Therefore, I strongly recommend you to get flu vaccine. Is that fine with you?
Mr. Ammann, I don't think you will get it as very small percentage of people gets it. So, should I give you?
Mr. Ammann, I am not sure why you are so worried. It is very good vaccine to fight against seasonal flu. So I will give you.
1
Many patients avoid taking flu vaccine as they are afraid of getting any side-effects of flu vaccine such as soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given or it can cause low-grade fever or aches. They will subside in a day or two. Patients should be counseled about it and flu vaccine should be recommended strongly.

Q.35 A 45 year old female, Ms. Michelle Koay, comes to clinic for routine follow up. She denied any symptoms. Her mother had breast cancer at the age of 56 years. She wants to check herself for breast cancer as she was concerned about it. She recently started her new job at local Supermarket and she is not too sure about her insurance coverage. So, she asked you, "Doc, will it cover by my insurance?"
Ms. Koay, I appreciate that you want to get mammogram. Generally most of the insurances cover screening mammogram. I will check with your insurance company. So let me order it.
Ms. Koay, I don’t know whether it would be covered or not. But meanwhile, you can pay out-of-pocket as it is very important test.
Ms. Koay, I am not sure. Could you please find out by calling your insurance company? If it is covered, I will order it.
Ms. Koay, Mammogram is a very important screening test so it should be covered however; let me find out for you. Once you come next time, I will order Mammogram. Is that fine with you?
1
Screening mammogram is mostly covered by all insurance companies as it is proven screening test to detect breast cancer early. Many times, if patient changes her job, then, she may not know as it is not that simple to find out. As a physician, you should offer assistance in dealing with insurance company. You can also refer her to financial counselor if it is available in your clinic/hospital. Never post-pone any test as many times patient will not come back and you will lose that opportunity.

Q.36 A 28 year old female, Mrs. Erika Nabel, comes to clinic for annual physical examination. She denied any symptoms but express her desire to become pregnant. She smokes about 1 PPD for last 3 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. She recently read about bad effects of smoking on baby and wants to quit smoking. She asked you, "Doc, how long does it take to stop smoking?"
Ms. Nabel, It depends on how quickly you quit smoking. You can do it as short as two weeks or might need more time. Therefore, I would suggest you not to become pregnant in next 6 months until you quit smoking.
Ms. Nabel, I think you can do it in a week as it is not difficult. After that you can become pregnant.
Ms. Nabel, I appreciate your decision to quit smoking. By doing so, you can avoid all long term complications of smoking as well as any bad effects on baby. Duration for smoking cessation varies, but once you stop smoking for a while, you can become pregnant.
Ms. Nabel, It is good idea to quit smoking. However, it would be very difficult. You need to take nicotine patch or gums and it is hazardous to baby, so you should not become pregnant until you quit smoking.
3
Smoking has many deleterious health effects not only on pregnant female but also on baby. Therefore, decision to quit smoking should be always appreciated. Duration varies which depends on patient’s determination to quit smoking, dependence on nicotine and many other factors. During this period patient might need nicotine gum or patch that can affect baby as well. So until, patient quit smoking completely, pregnancy should be avoided.

Mr. Hernandez, I am not so sure, I think it is hazardous to your health as well, but let me find out for you.
Mr. Hernandez, that is wrong information. You should quit even smokeless tobacco.

Many people have myth that smokeless tobacco is a safe alternative to cigarettes, although it is as dangerous as smoking. Tobacco-chewer become chemically dependent on them as nicotine can achieve higher blood concentration then smoker. It can also cause oral cancer, heart disease, teeth and gum disorders and many more. So, it should be explained to patient and strongly suggested to quit smoking.

Mr. Hernandez, that is totally wrong. Light cigarettes are nothing but cigarettes with tiny holes just where your fingers hold them. It is as dangerous as regular cigarettes. So I would suggest you to quit it.
Mr. Hernandez, I agree with you but it can still cause various problems such as lung cancer, heart diseases and many more. So please quit it.
Mr. Hernandez, Every cigarette can cause same problems. There is no difference between light cigarettes and regular cigarettes as light cigarettes have tiny holes just where your fingers hold them. So I would suggest you to quit smoking.

Talk with cancer patient is always challenging as patient is very anxious and sometimes depressed as well. You should re-assure him that you will do everything possible to help him. Cancer treatment needs multi-disciplinary approach, so, radiation oncologist, surgical oncologist, medical oncologist, oncology social worker; support groups, palliative care team and family should be involved as soon as possible if appropriate.
